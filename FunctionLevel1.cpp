/*ðŸ§  What is a Function?
A function is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task.

Think of it like a machine in your kitchen:

You give it input (like ingredients), it does something (cook), and gives output (food).

#include <stdio.h>

void greet() {
    printf("Hello, Abin!\n");
}

int main() {
    greet();  // calling the function
    return 0;
}
